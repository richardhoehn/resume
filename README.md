# Welcome
Welcome to my resume. During my acdemic life I have used LaTeX a lot, but genreally only as an acdemic paper editor and the ocasional letter. Wiht this resume I took LaTeX to a whole new level in terms of desing and internal linking.

Feel free to use it however you see fit.

Thanks,
Richard Hoehn
